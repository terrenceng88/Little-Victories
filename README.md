# Little-Victories
This is my post Hackathon Code for CruzHacks 2019, (1/18/19 - 21/20/19). 
Little victories is a journal app made for people to quickly write down
their little victories or things that made them happy so that when they 
are in doubt, they can look back at it to give themselves a reason to smile :)
